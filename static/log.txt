    2) Completed code for defense robot
9/21/2025
    1) Added indexer motors
    2) Added control for indexer motors
9/28/2025
    1) Separated tank drive and indexer control into util_funcs
    2) Organized self-wrtten header files into the folder 'custom'
    2) Fixed RclTracking::startTracking() (Combined lifeTimeLoop and syncLoop into miscLoop and reduced the amount of pros::Task)
10/7/2025
    1) Organized .cpp files for custom .h files into the folder 'custom'
    2) Added placeholders for components of new bot
    3) Finished drafting 'void updateIntake()' and 'void updatePneumatics()' in 'util_funcs'
    4) Updated 'void opcontrol()' accordingly
10/8/2025
    1) Added all motor ports
    2) Fixed util_funcs.cpp, congif.h not properly included per file directory.
    3) Added nullptr detection in Singly_Linked_List::void insert() for head node validity
    4) Added nullptr detection in Singly_Linked_List::void remove() after the while loop
10/11/2025
    1) Improved 'Singly_Linked_List'
        - Allowed iterators to insert / remove during iterations
        - Improved nullptr detections
    2) Improved 'RclTracking::void lifeTimeUpdate()' algorithm with iterator features
    3) Replaced static objects in 'config.h' with inline objects
    4) Replaced static objects in 'auton_selector.h' with inline objects
    5) Replaced static objects in 'util_funcs.h' with inline objects
10/12/2025
    1) Implemented auton routes 'red_left,' 'red_right,' and 'red_soloAWP'
    2) Created intake & pneumatics control functions for auton
10/13/2025
    1) Changed pneumatics to respective ports
    2) Defined odometry sensors (not implemented into drivetrain constructor due to error)
10/14/2025
    1) Revised background task-managing strategies (Store pointers to RclTracking and Display tasks instead of objects)
10/15/2025
    1) Pushed yesterday's work on sawp
    2) Began sklls
10/16/2025
    1) Modified middle goal function.
    2) Changed middle goal to score on R1, top on R2.
10/18/2025
    1) Adjusted names of RclTracking function names
    2) Added confidence test for distance sensor readings higher than 200 mm and less than 2000 mm
    3) Added function 'RclTracking::void updateBotPosition(RclSensor* sens)' to allow position corrections based on targeted distance sensors
    4) Added calls to 'RclTracking::void setRclPose()' alongside 'chassis.setPose()' in auton functions
